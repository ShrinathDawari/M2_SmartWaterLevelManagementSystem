## Introduction



Water level monitoring is the project which will be helpful in preventing water from wasting due to overflow and water shortage in the tank. This will help in industries where everything is automated and where water is used as a main element for production and manufacturing.

## Features

The main features of this project is , it displays the water level in an LCD display thereby informing the user whether the water must be filled in or not in a tank. The flow of the water stops when it is filled fully automatically thereby helping the user. Hence from the above features this project is user friendly.


## SWOT Analysis

Strengths of this project is water resource is conserved and manpower is reduced.
Weakness of the project is since water is used , maintanance is required. 
Opportunities of this project is, the data that is diplayed in output can be transmitted to the user directly.
Threats is the project is with more different versions.
